# 🧠 AssumptionsCheckers

AssumptionsCheckers is a modular toolkit for validating machine learning assumptions across multiple domains — regression, classification, clustering, and time-series. It’s designed for diagnostic clarity, operational realism, and stakeholder transparency.

🔍 What it does

    ✅ Regression diagnostics: Linearity, homoscedasticity, multicollinearity, residual analysis

    ✅ Classification checks: Class balance, feature leakage, decision boundary sanity

    ✅ Clustering validation: Silhouette scores, stability checks, feature scaling impact

    ✅ Data integrity overlays: Missingness, outliers, distributional shifts, transcription errors

    ✅ Time-series (stretch goal): Stationarity, autocorrelation, seasonal decomposition

🧰 Modular overlays

Each diagnostic is implemented as a modular overlay, allowing:

    Plug-and-play integration with pipelines

    Regionally nuanced interference simulation

    Visual and summary-first reporting for stakeholders

🚀 Getting started 

git clone https://github.com/your-username/AssumptionsCheckers.git
