Everyone enjoys wearing nice new clothes, however do we really like the process of chosing them? At times, it is not only the matter of having to make a choice but the trouble of finding something, which can kill a lot of time and specially when your  doesn't fit with the in fashion. The colour along with the style and size, blue or red, long or short, medium or large. What is more, we can say that price is often very off-putting as well. Most people usually go shopping for something which is affordable, and many times they find, for example, a dress, they like a lot but they cannot buy it because it is terribly expensive. Then, I consider  a pain having to go around some more still thinking of that same dress. Finally, you always talk yourself into some piece of clothing but that ended up being a tiring day of going in and out of fitting rooms and figuring out discounts. etc. Is that enjoyable?",

         "It is said that shopping is becoming a new way of life for more and more people in the developed countries. Many people leave so many other activities for the pleasure of buying as many things as they can afford. Let us then ask: 'Is this activitie always enjoyable?'. Nobody can deny that the main advantage of going shopping is the fact that, to do so, you do not need to make any effort. Far from the strengh that practising a sport or even going to work require, going shopping is something you can do either on your own or with all your family and it could not be easier; you only need a good pair of shoes and a wallet full of money. However, this apparently quite and relaxed activitie can sometimes turn into a living hell; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then, if you do go, you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people, unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy by the mixture of smells that come from the people. Nevertheless the worst will come when you lose the youngest member of your family and you have to spend the whole day looking for him/her. On balance I would say that although it is true that shopping it is not a difficult activitie, it is also true that  is definetly not an enjoyable one.",

         "Shopping is not always enjoyable. In my opinion, I do agree with this expression. One of the most unforgettable habit of city life is going out for shopping. I used to hang around famous cloth shops looking at the new arrival clothes section. It is not only a good fun to see the new fashions and things but  also decrease the  money in my pocket. Sometime shopping doesn't give anything to you but always waste all your free time. A group of girls can spend their time in a shopping center forever. It seems to me that more people in my hometown tend to go shopping in their free time because the shopping complexs nowadays are more attractive and combine every facilities inside. From my point of view, someone goes shopping just because he/she wants to show off that he/she is wealthy. Keeping  balance between daily life and shopping life may give more enjoyable rather than always walking in an air-conditioned shopping complex.",

         "In my opinion shopping is not always enjoyable. Very often, for example on Friday afternoon or Saturday, there are so many people in a shopping centre, that you can't move yourself forwards or backwards. Many people say that this is real shopping, when you queue for hours to pay only  a pair of socks or a bottle of mineral water at the supermarket. I think, you can't really enjoy shopping when there are hundreds of people and everyone wants to buy something. I like going shopping during the week, when I can look at each good a store sells. But for me it is better, when I go at the weekend because then I don't spend so much money because I think, before I have to queue for half an hour I buy nothing!",

I am happy to visit the United States under your organisation. Actually, I would like to go to Camp California next July because I have got two weeks holiday then. I also will be pleased to stay in  log cabins. My experience in camping is not so huge  to stay in  tents for 2 weeks. Therefore, you asked me what activities I would like to join . Surfing is something that I have ever wanted to try. As you can see, I have abosolutly no experience in it. Will it be possible to join a surf school? For the second activity I have chosen photography. I enjoy taking pictures of landscapes, I have also visited a photography course. So that my level is not  beginners anymore. Moreover, could you please tell me what kind of clothes I should take with me? What kind of money is used?. I am looking forward to going on holidays. Yours sincerely,. Mr Oliver Herre",

         "Generally, most people like shopping, but there are some advantages and disadvantages. When discribing the advantages, we should remember that most people like doing shopping. It is very pleasant when you are looking for something special or for special occasions like wedding, birthday,  Christmas presents. Next, it can be very good for your wallet to save some money, when you will find a bargain or sales. As well as that, some shop-assistance can give you a lower price, because you always do shopping at their shop. What is more, most people cannot live without shopping. It is their way to spend free time. On the other hand, there are some minuses. On top of that, shopping is very tiring and exhausting. Walking from shop to shop carrying heavy bags, takes much of your time. Instead of that you could do more interesting things. such as playing sports or reading a book. Besides that, shopping steal you from money. Very often people go to a shop - usually a big departament store and buy things which they do not need. In my opinion shopping is very tiring and I usually try to avoid doing it. When I have to, I do it, but I think we waste too much time on it that we should. On balance some people still like shopping even if it is not always enjoyable and they have to stand in a long queue to buy something. From my point of view it depands on us if shopping will be enjoyable or not.",

         "Thank you very much for the prize. I am writing this letter to inform you that I have recieved your letters and I am going to the trip. I would like to go to the trip in July because my school, which is Berkeley International School, is going to arrange the end of term break both for staff and students. Other reason is I think in July the weather is not so cold. The weather condition will be suitable for camping. I prefer to live in tents to log cabin because sleeping in the tent makes me more comfortable and I can get closer to the nature. Every night I would like to come out of the small tent to the nice enviroment outside the tent. Although, living in the tent is more comfortable. I'll have to be aware about insects so I've bought so many insects repellant. I can choose to do 2 activities so I would like to play tennis and  swimming. When I was in  fourth form, I got the first prize in  swimming competition and third prize in tennis. I was a bit disapotted with the result because I was expected to win the first prize or secound price. Lastly, I would like to ask you  questions. First, how many clothes do I have to bring? And do I have to bring some money. It will be very kind of you, if you can answer my questions. Your sincerely,. Seua Thanapol.",

         "This composition is about shopping. People today shops sevendays a week with their family, friends etc. But I think shopping is not always enjoyable. This statement is due to the great amount of rubbish we are providing for the world. The more stuff we buy the more we throw away. Shopping with some friends may be fun but you must also remember that you are spending money. Therefor you should think more carefully about what you are about to buy. You can enjoy yourself in other different ways. For example, you can do sports which is enjoyable and good for your health. Would you rather spend money on something which is destroying the world or do sports which is for your own benefit. You must think about your children who would be living in the world you helped to destroy. The ozone layer is being punctured when plastics or foams are burnt. I think this is all I have to say to make you think that shopping isn't always enjoyable and change your view in looking at shopping.",

Some people are in a hurry other are agressive and most of the other are very stressed. It is not always like that but we often see such a scene, even though shopping is becoming an entertainement not only for teenagers but also for adults. We have more and more shops everywhere and they sale everything. Because of that, people's need has increase a lot nowadays. It is also the reason why we have all these new supermarkets. In the one hand, it is very enjoyable to go shopping because we can find a lot of things. Sometimes we need them and sometimes we don't but it is fun to buy new clothes, furniture and so one. In the other hand, the  service in the shops or supermarkets has decrease a lot those last  years. The shop assistants are not always nice and sometimes they don't even know a bit about what they sell. In my opinion, shopping is not always enjoyable especially when there is too many people in there.",

         "Shopping is not always enjoyable. The first idea about shopping is that buying something will make a pleasure to the buyer and for that reason, will be enjoyable. But this is not always the case: at first, you see a very pretty item which you'd like to try . When you ask to, the seller offen answers that your size is missing. Hopeful, you try to find the same thing in another shop. You ask the seller for your size. His answer is: \"Everything is here, Madam!\" As you understand that you won't get any help, you waste your time looking for the right size. Finally, you find the right one but you don't have enough money. At the time you realise it, you also realise that the shop is closing in five minutes. So, you run to the bank but have to wait for the queue. There is only one minute left! It's your turn and you do as quick as possible. You run back to the shop and get your item. But now, you are very tired and need a good rest!",

         "To Mr. Robertson. I am writing to tell you something about the three-day trip to London. I have seen your programme for the trip and I think it is going to be a great trip. Thank you very much for organising this trip and putting all your spare time and effort into it. Personally, I enjoy looking  and learning about new inventions and all the science. That is why I think the trip to the science museum is a good idea. However, my class and I have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show. We are attracted to this show and would like to go. Unfortunately, it is on 14th March, which is the day we will be visiting the science museum. This show is on the 14th March. It is in the Central Exhibition Hall and will start and ten o'clock and finish at five o'clock in the evening. Apparently, this show is free to all students, which means if we went, the cost of the trip will be cut down. I think it is a great opportunity because it is based on fashion. We like to keep up with the rage but I think it will help those who want to become a fashion designer later on. I have a suggestion on how the programme could be changed. The shopping time could be after the show and the free time exchanged for the science museum. If we go to the show, we can do without the free time. Please give this your careful consideration.. Yours sincerely,",

I went out for shopping and to get some ideas about new brand computers and  products. First of all I went to a local shop but I couldn't find enough selection of products. Then I visited another one, in Cambridge Street. It was very crowded, I could hardly walk in the shop. I decided to by a CD room driver for my old computer. When I approached to the cashier I suddenly noticed my wallet had gone. My money, travel card and credit card . It was a nightmare there were pickpokets in the shop. I went to the shop assistance but it was useless. As soon as possible I phoned to my bank for cancelation of my credit card but they had already used it. it costs me about Ã‚Â£500. This experience has changed my shopping habit, now I do all my shopping on the internet. But I'm not sure how it is safe. But you must be always award against to pickpokets.",

It starts with food (monstruous) and goes on with clothes, pills, games and so on. It never ends! But unlikely to what you could think, I love shopping. I find it a very relaxing moment. At home, you have to work hard and you're often stressful because of your children  always asking you for something. When you're shopping, you can finally relax, just admiring what you're seeing. Your only work consist in choosing what suits you or buying what you prefer for dinner for instance; furthermore you're not disturbed: it's a dream!. To be fair, I must say that I've noticed one disadvantage on shopping: you need money!. You'll understand, I'm sure, that I prefer shopping at the beginning of every month. In order to change this situation I could win the lottery: a dream too!",

For some people it's great fun, but for some other it's a \"must\". In my opinion, shopping is like relaxing. I like to go very often, to look around and to buy some new clothes. As long as I am not searching for something specific. When I must buy something, I usually can't find it and then the shopping become a nightmare. On the other hand, when you go with someone else shopping, and you both want to see and buy different things, it can also be boring and uninteresting. Then it is perhaps better, when you make an appointment in one hour and everybody enjoys the shopping alone. To sum up, I would like to say that for to have an exciting shopping , you have sometimes to plan it or just be in the right mood.",

         "Shopping is not always enjouable because of several factorors. One could be when you go into a shop and you can find something that you like, and you decide to buy it, but when you see the price, you find out that it's too expencive, and you cannot afford to buy it. The only thing you mostly say is, \"If I had more money, I would buy it\", or \"I wish I had more money.\". Another factor could be when you are in a shop and you are not well attended , the people that work in the shop are doing other things, and cannot help you, so you have to look for the things you want to buy by your own. I think this is a common problem in shops, and that's why sometimes people leave the shop without buying anything, and I thing the solution would be to hire more workers. The third and last factor would be when you like a certain type of clothes, and you don't find any of that kind. You just find the type of clothes you would never wear. This cituation is very annoying for most of the people, and that's what makes shopping unejoyable.",

Everyone enjoys wearing nice new clothes, however do we really like the process of chosing them? At times, it is not only the matter of having to make a choice but the trouble of finding something, which can kill a lot of time and specially when your  doesn't fit with the in fashion. The colour along with the style and size, blue or red, long or short, medium or large. What is more, we can say that price is often very off-putting as well. Most people usually go shopping for something which is affordable, and many times they find, for example, a dress, they like a lot but they cannot buy it because it is terribly expensive. Then, I consider  a pain having to go around some more still thinking of that same dress. Finally, you always talk yourself into some piece of clothing but that ended up being a tiring day of going in and out of fitting rooms and figuring out discounts. etc. Is that enjoyable?",

         "It is said that shopping is becoming a new way of life for more and more people in the developed countries. Many people leave so many other activities for the pleasure of buying as many things as they can afford. Let us then ask: 'Is this activitie always enjoyable?'. Nobody can deny that the main advantage of going shopping is the fact that, to do so, you do not need to make any effort. Far from the strengh that practising a sport or even going to work require, going shopping is something you can do either on your own or with all your family and it could not be easier; you only need a good pair of shoes and a wallet full of money. However, this apparently quite and relaxed activitie can sometimes turn into a living hell; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then, if you do go, you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people, unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy by the mixture of smells that come from the people. Nevertheless the worst will come when you lose the youngest member of your family and you have to spend the whole day looking for him/her. On balance I would say that although it is true that shopping it is not a difficult activitie, it is also true that  is definetly not an enjoyable one.",

         "Shopping is not always enjoyable. In my opinion, I do agree with this expression. One of the most unforgettable habit of city life is going out for shopping. I used to hang around famous cloth shops looking at the new arrival clothes section. It is not only a good fun to see the new fashions and things but  also decrease the  money in my pocket. Sometime shopping doesn't give anything to you but always waste all your free time. A group of girls can spend their time in a shopping center forever. It seems to me that more people in my hometown tend to go shopping in their free time because the shopping complexs nowadays are more attractive and combine every facilities inside. From my point of view, someone goes shopping just because he/she wants to show off that he/she is wealthy. Keeping  balance between daily life and shopping life may give more enjoyable rather than always walking in an air-conditioned shopping complex.",

Very often, for example on Friday afternoon or Saturday, there are so many people in a shopping centre, that you can't move yourself forwards or backwards. Many people say that this is real shopping, when you queue for hours to pay only  a pair of socks or a bottle of mineral water at the supermarket. I think, you can't really enjoy shopping when there are hundreds of people and everyone wants to buy something. I like going shopping during the week, when I can look at each good a store sells. But for me it is better, when I go at the weekend because then I don't spend so much money because I think, before I have to queue for half an hour I buy nothing!",

I am happy to visit the United States under your organisation. Actually, I would like to go to Camp California next July because I have got two weeks holiday then. I also will be pleased to stay in  log cabins. My experience in camping is not so huge  to stay in  tents for 2 weeks. Therefore, you asked me what activities I would like to join . Surfing is something that I have ever wanted to try. As you can see, I have abosolutly no experience in it. Will it be possible to join a surf school? For the second activity I have chosen photography. I enjoy taking pictures of landscapes, I have also visited a photography course. So that my level is not  beginners anymore. Moreover, could you please tell me what kind of clothes I should take with me? What kind of money is used?. I am looking forward to going on holidays. Yours sincerely,. Mr Oliver Herre",

         "Generally, most people like shopping, but there are some advantages and disadvantages. When discribing the advantages, we should remember that most people like doing shopping. It is very pleasant when you are looking for something special or for special occasions like wedding, birthday,  Christmas presents. Next, it can be very good for your wallet to save some money, when you will find a bargain or sales. As well as that, some shop-assistance can give you a lower price, because you always do shopping at their shop. What is more, most people cannot live without shopping. It is their way to spend free time. On the other hand, there are some minuses. On top of that, shopping is very tiring and exhausting. Walking from shop to shop carrying heavy bags, takes much of your time. Instead of that you could do more interesting things. such as playing sports or reading a book. Besides that, shopping steal you from money. Very often people go to a shop - usually a big departament store and buy things which they do not need. In my opinion shopping is very tiring and I usually try to avoid doing it. When I have to, I do it, but I think we waste too much time on it that we should. On balance some people still like shopping even if it is not always enjoyable and they have to stand in a long queue to buy something. From my point of view it depands on us if shopping will be enjoyable or not.",

         "Thank you very much for the prize. I am writing this letter to inform you that I have recieved your letters and I am going to the trip. I would like to go to the trip in July because my school, which is Berkeley International School, is going to arrange the end of term break both for staff and students. Other reason is I think in July the weather is not so cold. The weather condition will be suitable for camping. I prefer to live in tents to log cabin because sleeping in the tent makes me more comfortable and I can get closer to the nature. Every night I would like to come out of the small tent to the nice enviroment outside the tent. Although, living in the tent is more comfortable. I'll have to be aware about insects so I've bought so many insects repellant. I can choose to do 2 activities so I would like to play tennis and  swimming. When I was in  fourth form, I got the first prize in  swimming competition and third prize in tennis. I was a bit disapotted with the result because I was expected to win the first prize or secound price. Lastly, I would like to ask you  questions. First, how many clothes do I have to bring? And do I have to bring some money. It will be very kind of you, if you can answer my questions. Your sincerely,. Seua Thanapol.",

This statement is due to the great amount of rubbish we are providing for the world. The more stuff we buy the more we throw away. Shopping with some friends may be fun but you must also remember that you are spending money. Therefor you should think more carefully about what you are about to buy. You can enjoy yourself in other different ways. For example, you can do sports which is enjoyable and good for your health. Would you rather spend money on something which is destroying the world or do sports which is for your own benefit. You must think about your children who would be living in the world you helped to destroy. The ozone layer is being punctured when plastics or foams are burnt. I think this is all I have to say to make you think that shopping isn't always enjoyable and change your view in looking at shopping.",

Some people are in a hurry other are agressive and most of the other are very stressed. It is not always like that but we often see such a scene, even though shopping is becoming an entertainement not only for teenagers but also for adults. We have more and more shops everywhere and they sale everything. Because of that, people's need has increase a lot nowadays. It is also the reason why we have all these new supermarkets. In the one hand, it is very enjoyable to go shopping because we can find a lot of things. Sometimes we need them and sometimes we don't but it is fun to buy new clothes, furniture and so one. In the other hand, the  service in the shops or supermarkets has decrease a lot those last  years. The shop assistants are not always nice and sometimes they don't even know a bit about what they sell.

But this is not always the case: at first, you see a very pretty item which you'd like to try . When you ask to, the seller offen answers that your size is missing. Hopeful, you try to find the same thing in another shop. You ask the seller for your size. His answer is: \"Everything is here, Madam!\" As you understand that you won't get any help, you waste your time looking for the right size. Finally, you find the right one but you don't have enough money. At the time you realise it, you also realise that the shop is closing in five minutes. So, you run to the bank but have to wait for the queue. There is only one minute left! It's your turn and you do as quick as possible. You run back to the shop and get your item.

         "To Mr. Robertson. I am writing to tell you something about the three-day trip to London. I have seen your programme for the trip and I think it is going to be a great trip. Thank you very much for organising this trip and putting all your spare time and effort into it. Personally, I enjoy looking  and learning about new inventions and all the science. That is why I think the trip to the science museum is a good idea. However, my class and I have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show. We are attracted to this show and would like to go. Unfortunately, it is on 14th March, which is the day we will be visiting the science museum. This show is on the 14th March. It is in the Central Exhibition Hall and will start and ten o'clock and finish at five o'clock in the evening. Apparently, this show is free to all students, which means if we went, the cost of the trip will be cut down. I think it is a great opportunity because it is based on fashion. We like to keep up with the rage but I think it will help those who want to become a fashion designer later on. I have a suggestion on how the programme could be changed. The shopping time could be after the show and the free time exchanged for the science museum. If we go to the show, we can do without the free time. Please give this your careful consideration.. Yours sincerely,",

         "Shopping is not always enjoyable. I like shopping but I had a bad experience about my recent shopping . I went out for shopping and to get some ideas about new brand computers and  products. First of all I went to a local shop but I couldn't find enough selection of products. Then I visited another one, in Cambridge Street. It was very crowded, I could hardly walk in the shop. I decided to by a CD room driver for my old computer. When I approached to the cashier I suddenly noticed my wallet had gone. My money, travel card and credit card . It was a nightmare there were pickpokets in the shop. I went to the shop assistance but it was useless. As soon as possible I phoned to my bank for cancelation of my credit card but they had already used it. it costs me about Ã‚Â£500.

We are concerned that this is a great and the only opportunity for us to see this show, as it takes place only once a year and only in London. Certainly, we do not refuse to take part in other activities in London. Probably, you will agree just to put  London Fashion and Leisure Show instead of  Science Museum and shopping on Tuesday.

         "Shopping is  my everyday life. I'm a mother of four children and you can easily imagine how many things I have to buy in a week. It starts with food (monstruous) and goes on with clothes, pills, games and so on. It never ends! But unlikely to what you could think, I love shopping. I find it a very relaxing moment. At home, you have to work hard and you're often stressful because of your children  always asking you for something. When you're shopping, you can finally relax, just admiring what you're seeing. Your only work consist in choosing what suits you or buying what you prefer for dinner for instance; furthermore you're not disturbed: it's a dream!. To be fair, I must say that I've noticed one disadvantage on shopping: you need money!. You'll understand, I'm sure, that I prefer shopping at the beginning of every month. In order to change this situation I could win the lottery: a dream too!",

         "Shopping is not always enjoyable. I would like to begin this composition by saying that, not for everyone is shopping the same. For some people it's great fun, but for some other it's a \"must\". In my opinion, shopping is like relaxing. I like to go very often, to look around and to buy some new clothes. As long as I am not searching for something specific. When I must buy something, I usually can't find it and then the shopping become a nightmare. On the other hand, when you go with someone else shopping, and you both want to see and buy different things, it can also be boring and uninteresting. Then it is perhaps better, when you make an appointment in one hour and everybody enjoys the shopping alone. To sum up, I would like to say that for to have an exciting shopping , you have sometimes to plan it or just be in the right mood.",

         "Shopping is not always enjouable because of several factorors. One could be when you go into a shop and you can find something that you like, and you decide to buy it, but when you see the price, you find out that it's too expencive, and you cannot afford to buy it. The only thing you mostly say is, \"If I had more money, I would buy it\", or \"I wish I had more money.\". Another factor could be when you are in a shop and you are not well attended , the people that work in the shop are doing other things, and cannot help you, so you have to look for the things you want to buy by your own. I think this is a common problem in shops, and that's why sometimes people leave the shop without buying anything, and I thing the solution would be to hire more workers. The third and last factor would be when you like a certain type of clothes, and you don't find any of that kind. You just find the type of clothes you would never wear. This cituation is very annoying for most of the people, and that's what makes shopping unejoyable.",
